## The Odin Project Restaurant page

A project that aims to teach the use of webpack and how to dynamically create the entire content for a page.  Part of The Odin Project, find the assingment [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page).

The page has been only minimally styled, as it was not the main purpose of this project. As I decided not to make it pretty, I strived to make it as bleary and depressing as the pub whose page it purposes to be.

The map in Contact -page points to a pub voted the most depressing in Manchester. 

## What have I learned during this project

- webpack configuration and use
- importing and exporting functions between modules
- using npm to install packages
- how useful a tool like webpack is to organise code for building and further maintainability
